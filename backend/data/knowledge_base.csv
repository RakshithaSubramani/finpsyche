Risk-Averse,Fear,"For risk-averse investors feeling fear, consider low-risk options like Fixed Deposits (FDs), Public Provident Fund (PPF), or Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in debt funds. These provide steady returns with minimal volatility."
Risk-Averse,Stress,"When stressed about finances, focus on building an emergency fund first. Aim for 6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account. Then explore government bonds or corporate bonds for stable income."
Risk-Averse,Hesitation,"If you're hesitant about investing, start small with SIPs. Invest Rs 500-1000 monthly in balanced mutual funds. This builds confidence gradually without overwhelming risk."
Risk-Taker,Excitement,"High-risk investments can be exciting but dangerous. Diversify across sectors: stocks, crypto, commodities. Never invest more than 10% of portfolio in single high-risk asset."
Risk-Taker,Overconfidence,"Overconfidence leads to losses. Set stop-loss limits, take profits regularly, and maintain 60% in stable assets. Remember: markets can crash anytime."

Impulsive,Excitement,"Impulsive spending destroys wealth. Use 24-hour rule: wait a day before purchases above Rs 5000. Create monthly budget and stick to it."
Impulsive,Stress,"Stress spending is dangerous. Track expenses daily using apps. Set up automatic savings that deduct before you can spend. Build emergency fund first."
Emotional,Fear,"Emotional decisions lead to losses. When fearful, don't sell in panic. Consult a financial advisor. Focus on long-term goals, not daily market movements."
Emotional,Stress,"Financial stress needs systematic approach. List all debts, prioritize high-interest ones. Create realistic budget. Consider debt consolidation if needed."
